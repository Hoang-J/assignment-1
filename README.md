# Assignment 1

## Setup

1. Fork this repository

2. Clone your fork of the repository

## Problem 1

Every commit in a repository has a _hash_ associated with it. A commit's **hash** is a 40-character length sequence of random letters and/or digits that is generated based on the contents of the commit, thus making it useful to uniquely identify each commit.

**Find the hash of the first commit in this repository and write it to a file named `first_commit`. Add this file to the repo in a commit titled "Problem 1".**

## Problem 2

Go to [futurecoder.io](https://futurecoder.io/) and finish from "The Shell" up to until "Lists".

In Python, you can accept user input via the `input` function like so:

```python
x = input("Enter your age in years: ")
print(f"You are {x} years old")
```

**Create a timer program where the user will input a number of seconds and then a count down will begin.**

Example:

```
>>> # of seconds: 10
10
9
8
7
6
5
4
3
2
1
Ding!
```

## Stuck?

Most of software engineering is searching around for information. Always try to Google around first before asking in Discord.
